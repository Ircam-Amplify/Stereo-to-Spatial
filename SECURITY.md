## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within Stereo-to-Spatial, please:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email the project maintainers directly
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow up to 48 hours for an initial response
5. Please do not disclose the issue publicly until it has been addressed

## Security Considerations

- All API credentials should be kept secure and never committed to the repository
- Always use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Follow security best practices when handling user data and files
- Use secure protocols for all API communications

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. Users will be notified through:

- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Direct communication for critical issues

## Best Practices

1. Keep your IRCAM Amplify API credentials secure
2. Regularly update dependencies
3. Monitor server logs for suspicious activity
4. Follow the principle of least privilege
